      <title>New X Men 144</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Grant Morrison&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;New X-Men&lt;/em&gt; run might be the greatest X-Men run ever. Yes, I know people will argue that the Claremont/Byrne or Lee/Kirby era might be (or &amp;ldquo;definitely is&amp;rdquo;) better. I know some will say that Joss Whedon&amp;rsquo;s steaming garbage pile is superior. But they are wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Morrison cranked up the strangeness of the X-Men and, following the stylistic shift introduced with the X-Men films, really took the characters to incredibly interesting places&amp;hellip;although I will confess that having Xorn turn out to be Magneto was a letdown. (Having a character with a black hole for a head/brain is so much cooler.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Positioning mutants as something more than metaphor-for-bigotry, which Morrison did throughout his run, was innovative as hell. Mutants became threats not only to human evolution in the biological sense but in the &lt;em&gt;cultural&lt;/em&gt; sense: historical/traditional norms were getting rejected left and right.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Issue 144 touches on this obliquely. But it&amp;rsquo;s mostly a story about Fantomex (a new character introduced by Morrison) and Wolverine. As a result, it&amp;rsquo;s a weaker tale than some of the preceding stories.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cover features Cyclops with his back to the reader, although he&amp;rsquo;s turning around over his shoulder to look in the reader&amp;rsquo;s general direction (or so it appears; it&amp;rsquo;s hard to tell exactly where he&amp;rsquo;s looking when he has his visor on).&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;

    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;New X-Men issue 144&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Among the brain-melters Morrison offered was that the &amp;ldquo;Weapon X&amp;rdquo; program where Wolverine was given his adamantium skeleton was in fact referring to X not as mutant but as the Roman numeral for 10, meaning that there were nine predecessors (including Captain America!). Fantomex was Weapon 13 and so an improvement upon the body horror fuckery that the scientists put Wolverine through.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this issue, Fantomex, Cyclops, and Wolverine move through an environment called &amp;ldquo;The World&amp;rdquo; in which various inhabitants and technologies develop in bizarre ways (they encounter a flying vehicle that Fantomex rationalizes as roughly being the equivalent of putting a whale brain under the hood of a truck).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is an exposition-heavy issue&amp;ndash;it&amp;rsquo;s part 3 of the larger story arc&amp;ndash;but Morrison manages to cram in not only exposition but also action, as the trio are forced to deal with a released Weapon 15, who supposedly makes Wolverine and Fantomex look like fossils dinosaurs by comparison of their abilities to its. Weapon 15 eventually escapes &amp;ldquo;The World&amp;rdquo; and launches itself at a satellite, where the next issue leads us. We end up not really having to &lt;em&gt;know&lt;/em&gt; a whole lot, but the setup is clearly meant to pay off in part 4 and/or 5 of the story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a fun read. Not remotely the intellectual stimulation of &lt;em&gt;Doom Patrol&lt;/em&gt; or much of Morrison&amp;rsquo;s other work, but it still causes me to reconsider what I think I understand about the X-Men in ways that no other author has managed to (the closest is Peter Milligan, whose &lt;em&gt;X-Force&lt;/em&gt; / &lt;em&gt;X-Statix&lt;/em&gt; run is similarly amazing). For a franchise that, up until Morrison took over, I&amp;rsquo;d written off after getting exhausted by the early 90s overexposure (X-posure?), I&amp;rsquo;d say this is an incredible feat.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Green Lantern (2005) 001</title>
      <link>https://brocktopus.github.io/longbox/post/Green-Lantern-001/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 05 Dec 2016 14:50:30 -0500</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://brocktopus.github.io/longbox/post/Green-Lantern-001/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;For today&amp;rsquo;s post, we&amp;rsquo;ll look at the first issue of Geoff Johns&amp;rsquo; run on &lt;em&gt;Green Lantern&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a new series, you might expect that the comic provides a lot of exposition &amp;amp; setup for the epic story to come. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; do that much if at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cover, painted by Alex Ross in his realistic style, features Green Lantern Hal Jordan flying among the clouds on a bright, sunny day, reaching out toward the reader. His power ring leaves a green trail behind him.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;https://brocktopus.github.io/longbox/img/Green-Lantern-001.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Cover to Green Lantern (2005) 001, described above&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Green Lantern (2005) issue 001&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The first five pages or so provide a brief retelling of the origin, tweaked just enough to suit Johns&amp;rsquo; future purposes. The rest of the story requires pretty significant knowledge of the Green Lantern mythos published up to this point&amp;ndash;most notably Hal Jordan&amp;rsquo;s tenure as Parallax, the personification of fear, who engaged in some genocide-level violence before Hal died (and was attached to the Spectre, the agent of God&amp;rsquo;s wrath) and was brought back to life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most of these details aren&amp;rsquo;t really covered at all, or at least not substantially or explicitly; there are moments where Johns almost gives the reader enough detail to understand everything. In particular, if a reader approaches this comic without having read the &lt;em&gt;Green Lantern: Rebirth&lt;/em&gt; miniseries, I can&amp;rsquo;t imagine they comprehend much of what&amp;rsquo;s going on here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taken in the context of Johns&amp;rsquo; ovverall epic story, this is a solid, slow beginning. As a standalone issue? It kind of sucks&amp;ndash;at least for someone looking to get a full GL adventure. Hal and John Stewart investigate a satellite orbiting the planet, but the villain (a Manhunter, the robotic predecessor of the GL Corps) does not engage them&amp;ndash;it&amp;rsquo;s off killing civilians in a quest to end all human life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s ridiculous that I have to qualify the quality of the comic, but here we are nonetheless. Is it really so hard to write a complete 22-page story that&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;also&lt;/em&gt; a component of a larger story that only Grant Morrison seems to be able to pull it off (shout-out to &lt;em&gt;All-Star Superman&lt;/em&gt;!)?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Captain America 358</title>
      <link>https://brocktopus.github.io/longbox/post/Captain-America-358/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 02 Dec 2016 10:48:39 -0500</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://brocktopus.github.io/longbox/post/Captain-America-358/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hey, a Mark Gruenwald issue of &lt;em&gt;Captain America&lt;/em&gt;! And part of &amp;ldquo;The Bloodstone Saga,&amp;rdquo; to boot! But how well does it stack up to my memory?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My youngest brother, Patrick, is far more of a Captain America fan than I am. I think it&amp;rsquo;s fair to say that he, like me, really digs the Brubaker era most of all (which brought us the Winter Soldier and the assassination of Steve Rogers).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The mid-late 300s to 400s (issue-wise) of the original &lt;em&gt;Captain America&lt;/em&gt; run were not always great. &amp;ldquo;The Bloodstone Saga&amp;rdquo; stands out, though&amp;ndash;it involved the magical gem of Ulysses Bloodstone (nigh-invulnerable/immortal monster hunter) and introduced Red Skull crony Crossbones to the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cover to issue 358 shows Captain America crouching in tight quarters, in pit trap with a spiked floor. Cap&amp;rsquo;s shielding himself (literally) from a spiked ceiling trying to crush or impale him. In a text box in the bottom right corner, there&amp;rsquo;s text reading, &amp;ldquo;To rescue Diamondback, Cap enters the Caverns of Death!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;https://brocktopus.github.io/longbox/img/Captain-America-358.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Cover to Captain America 358, described above&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Captain America issue 358&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The issue ends up not really doing a whole lot well, pacing-wise. The first third of the comic is Cap&amp;rsquo;s navigation of a dungeon (the aforementioned &amp;ldquo;caverns of death&amp;rdquo;), but all related narration comes from thought bubbles as he recaps the relevant plot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eventually, Cap meets up with Diamondback (a character who&amp;rsquo;s always annoyed me, as she seems incompetent in the worst ways). Together, they manage to track down a fragment of the bloodstone&amp;ndash;but it&amp;rsquo;s in the headdress for a racially insensitive portrayal of an indigenous South American chieftain, who&amp;rsquo;s captured Batroc the Leaper, Baron Zemo, and others on what appears to be a giant roulette wheel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why did I buy this comic? (Actually, I know why. I wanted the complete &amp;ldquo;Bloodstone Saga&amp;rdquo; story to offer context for the early appearances of Crossbones. At the moment, I regret this decision.)&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Green Lantern (2005) 046</title>
      <link>https://brocktopus.github.io/longbox/post/Green-Lantern-046/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 30 Nov 2016 10:17:48 -0500</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://brocktopus.github.io/longbox/post/Green-Lantern-046/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;As I&amp;rsquo;ve noted elsewhere, I own more &lt;em&gt;Green Lantern&lt;/em&gt; comics than any other title/franchise, so I suppose it&amp;rsquo;s not surprising that the random selection of the comics I&amp;rsquo;m reviewing would hit multiple GL issues so early.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Green Lantern&lt;/em&gt; 046 is smack in the middle of Geoff Johns&amp;rsquo; epic space opera run on the character, so this issue is pretty much 100% action&amp;ndash;a stark contrast to the laser-focused character development of some other comics I&amp;rsquo;ve discussed recently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cover shows Green Lantern (Hal Jordan) flying through space, toward the viewer, next to Sinestro, with Star Sapphire position between and behind the others. Each of the ring-wielders is glowing in a light the color of their rings. Text along the bottom of the page reads &amp;ldquo;Uneasy Alliance.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;https://brocktopus.github.io/longbox/img/Green-Lantern-046.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Cover to Green Lantern (2005) 046, described above&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Green Lantern issue 046&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This issue is part of the &amp;ldquo;Blackest Night&amp;rdquo; storyline, a pretty genius concept by Johns to introduce a spectrum of colored light rings &amp;amp; corps to wield them, each corresponding to a different emotion (green = willpower, yellow = fear, orange = green, red = rage, blue = hope, indigo = compassion, violet = love). All of the corps, despite their signficant and fundamental ideological differences, had to come together to fight the threat of the Black Lantern Corps, an army of undead beings seeking to kill and assimilate all life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of moving plot parts in this issue that only make sense if one reads the whole storyline; for example, John Stewart appears in space for a page or two, but it&amp;rsquo;s entirely unclear what the hell is going on there in the context of this issue alone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of focus on Sinestro here, which I really dig. Despite the fact that Sinestro is a brutally fascist rogue Green Lantern, I find the examination of his psyche fascinating&amp;ndash;he works so well as a character because he&amp;rsquo;s clearly the logical extension of the GL Corps&amp;rsquo; goals. At what point should one&amp;rsquo;s willpower be limited? How can we be sure that someone with a strong will is also pure of heart or bound to an ethical worldview? (Obviously, we can&amp;rsquo;t, but we take it for granted that Hal &amp;amp; his allies are infallible in this regard &amp;hellip; other than that whole Parallax situation.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sinestro has one really interesting action moment where, after beating Mongul one-on-one, he drops his Corps&amp;rsquo; giant power battery on his enemy. It&amp;rsquo;s so ludicrous that it should be played for laughs, but the absurdity of this entire comic&amp;rsquo;s concept makes it seem just believable enough to accept.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast, I never really found myself interested in the Star Sapphires as characters. They&amp;rsquo;re often depicted as oversexualized, hormone-crazed women who are out to ruin the lives of the men they supposedly love. &lt;em&gt;Surely&lt;/em&gt; there&amp;rsquo;s a better way to approach this component of the GL franchise, right? Right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At any rate, this issue ends with the Black Lantern Corps arrival of Abin Sur (Hal Jordan&amp;rsquo;s predecessor and Sinestro&amp;rsquo;s mentor) and his sister Arin, a character who&amp;ndash;it turns out in a future issue&amp;ndash;was Sinestro&amp;rsquo;s love before she died. So there&amp;rsquo;s a big cliffhanger! The storyline is certainly interesting and compelling, but not in its individual serialized components &amp;hellip; which is a shame, because I really dig almost everything about the GL franchise.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Starman 023</title>
      <link>https://brocktopus.github.io/longbox/post/Starman-023/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 28 Nov 2016 20:44:04 -0500</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://brocktopus.github.io/longbox/post/Starman-023/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Starman&lt;/em&gt; was a comic by James Robinson, Tony Harris, Peter Snejberg, and other assorted artists in the mid-90s that told the tale of a young man named Jack Knight. Jack was the son of Golden Age (1940s)-era Starman Ted Knight and the younger brother of short-lived Starman David Knight. (There were a few other heroes who went by the name Starman, as well, but the Knight family really &amp;ldquo;owns&amp;rdquo; the role.) Jack had the hero role thrust upon him when his brother was murdered one night; Jack avenged his brother and decided to protect his city as his family had done. Along the way, we learn a tremendous amount about all the Starman heroes, Opal City (the setting), and a super-interesting cast of antagonists and supporting characters (most notably, villain-turned-ally The Shade and police family the O&amp;rsquo;Dares).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, it&amp;rsquo;s worth noting that none of the Knights has any super-powers. Ted was enough of a genius inventor to come up with the &amp;ldquo;cosmic rod&amp;rdquo; as an invention that allowed him, when wielding it, to fly, to fire energy blasts, and to do a few other neat tricks, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Starman&lt;/em&gt; is a series that I treasure (I have the complete series in individual issues as well as in the six-volume hardcover omnibus set). Everything about it is excellent: it&amp;rsquo;s a (mostly) self-contained story with a long, satisfying arc that offers a cathartic resolution for the main character. (In fact, it&amp;rsquo;s kind of incredible that DC hasn&amp;rsquo;t pressured anyone to try and pick the character back up since Robinson ended the run.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cover to &lt;em&gt;Starman&lt;/em&gt; 023 features a profile of the Sandman in his gas mask, presented in black-and-white, along with an outline of his gas gun, against the colorful and stylized, art deco-esque background. The background features a silhouette of Jack below a blimp or zeppelin flying but on fire and belching smoke from its rear. Halfway down the page is the story title and numbering: &amp;ldquo;Sand and Stars Part Four of Four.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;https://brocktopus.github.io/longbox/img/Starman-023.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Cover to Starman 023, described above&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Starman issue 023&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This issue is the finale to a really awesome story. One of Robinson&amp;rsquo;s skills on display throughout this run is his knowledge of, and ability to weave, DC&amp;rsquo;s history into the Starman saga (even though we&amp;rsquo;re meant to understand it as weaving Starman into DC&amp;rsquo;s history). In this case, Wesley Dodds, the Golden Age Sandman (so, not Morpheus from the Vertigo series), is called on to help with an old case that Ted Knight had worked on. At this point within the comics universe, Wesley has aged a great deal, even more so than Ted (who, it turns out, has aged a bit slower than his contemporaries).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nonetheless, when presented with a mystery, Wesley&amp;ndash;and his partner, the ever-capable Diane Belmont, who&amp;rsquo;s had a long career as a successful author&amp;ndash;immediately jumps into action. This issue begins immediately after one of the single strongest moments in superhero comics (occurring at the end of issue 022): Wesley, who recognizes his frailty and age, finds himself needed by Jack (who&amp;rsquo;s been captured and tortured). Wesley considers his fear of death, remembers a time when Ted Knight helped him in a moment of need, and then comes to a decision. Wesley thinks to himself, &amp;ldquo;A friend needed me. I was there. And he was there when I needed him. It seems I should recall what I said to young Jack. Be true to those words. Life must be measured by quality. And so &amp;hellip; if this is the last thing I do &amp;hellip; I die content.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then&amp;ndash;at the start of issue 023&amp;ndash;he busts in to save Jack so that Jack can go be the physical hero needed to take down the villain mastermind (an airship &amp;ldquo;accident&amp;rdquo; so the owner could collect insurance money). The issue is as much Wesley dealing with his age and envy (at seeing Jack performing the heroics he once did, years ago) as it is about Jack being Starman. And&amp;ndash;that&amp;rsquo;s totally ok, here. These characters are presented as fleshed-out beings rather than two-dimensional backdrops for the titular hero. In particular, Wesley Dodds is a unique mystery man who&amp;rsquo;s somehow managed to remain in enough memories that he&amp;rsquo;s not relegated to a figurative bench. We get to see how an old man&amp;ndash;even if he were once a fantastic hero&amp;ndash;come to terms with mortality and decide to own the terms of his death, thus proving himself worthy of the &amp;ldquo;hero&amp;rdquo; descriptor (even though, of course, he ends up surviving the adventure). That&amp;rsquo;s so much more interesting than if, say, we were to get a depiction of Wesley who&amp;rsquo;s unable to recognize his limitations or who fawns over Jack as being superior for being young and cool and healthy or whatever.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Give me more comics like this, please.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Avengers (1998) 062</title>
      <link>https://brocktopus.github.io/longbox/post/Avengers-062/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 24 Nov 2016 21:20:23 -0500</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://brocktopus.github.io/longbox/post/Avengers-062/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;While I am a &lt;em&gt;huge&lt;/em&gt; fan of Kurt Busiek&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Astro City&lt;/em&gt; comic, I never really found myself getting into his run on &lt;em&gt;Avengers&lt;/em&gt; (the second or third volume) while it happened. (I think at the time I was really into Bendis&amp;rsquo; &lt;em&gt;Daredevil&lt;/em&gt; and Morrison&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;New X-Men&lt;/em&gt; instead, since they were more blatantly and fully pushing back against some of Marvel&amp;rsquo;s status quo.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At any rate, in retrospect, this issue is fantastic, but not because it&amp;rsquo;s an &lt;em&gt;Avengers&lt;/em&gt; comic. It&amp;rsquo;s fantastic because it very clearly and precisely sets up a parallel narrative for Ant-Man (Scott Lang) and Jack of Hearts (Jack Hart &amp;hellip; yeah).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cover features the two squaring off in a scene from the story&amp;rsquo;s climax: Ant-Man stands on the left, helmet off and in one hand, the other pointed at Jack of Hearts; Ant-Man grits his teeth tensely. Similarly, Jack of Hearts, who&amp;rsquo;s on the right, stares back angrily and grits his teeth too. The background is comprised of speed/motion lines that keep the focus on the two heroes&amp;rsquo; faces.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;https://brocktopus.github.io/longbox/img/Avengers-062.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Cover to Avengers 062, described above&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Avengers issue 062&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The story reflects Busiek&amp;rsquo;s best work: explorations of character that keep the best and most important dramatic points centered on the protagonist(s) of a given tale. In this case, Jack of Hearts struggles with the problems he faces&amp;ndash;namely, that every day he has to spend so many hours in a cell with seven-foot-thick walls because he eventually discharges a daily burst of energy not unlike a nuclear bomb going off. During this story, Iron Man tells him that each day&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;cell time&amp;rdquo; will need to increase from 10 to 14 hours. As you might imagine, Jack doesn&amp;rsquo;t take this well &amp;hellip; and it doesn&amp;rsquo;t help that it turns out his father, who died during an accident connected to Jack, had been trying to save him (Jack thought he&amp;rsquo;d been focused on work instead of family).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time, Ant-Man is called to court to attend a custody hearing for his daughter Cassie (who would later become the hero Stature), because his ex-wife argues that his life is too dangerous to have his daughter around. The judge agrees, taking into consideration the Avengers&amp;rsquo; nigh-constant efforts to deal with global emergencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having lost his daughter, Ant-Man heads to the Avengers mansion to see about joining up with them officially (as he&amp;rsquo;d performed some &amp;ldquo;unofficial&amp;rdquo; or &lt;em&gt;ad hoc&lt;/em&gt; teamup work with them before this point). Jack of Hearts shows up and is angry that Ant-Man is offered a spot on the team freely, since he felt he&amp;rsquo;d had to struggle to join. The two butt heads but Iron Man and the Wasp manage to defuse the situation. Each of the combatants heads to his room (or cell) and is left alone with his thoughts, having nothing else really to build a life around.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a pretty brutal story, but I mean that in a good way. I&amp;rsquo;ve always thought Jack of Hearts was a lame character, but he&amp;rsquo;s given some significant depth here&amp;ndash;I mean, it&amp;rsquo;s not like the &lt;em&gt;character&lt;/em&gt; ever had any say about possessing such a lame origin&amp;ndash;and it&amp;rsquo;s juxtaposed very interestingly against Ant-Man&amp;rsquo;s problems. The tragedy, of course, is that Ant-Man and Jack of Hearts could very easily find friendship and solace in one another, but they&amp;rsquo;re so caught up in their individual drama that they can&amp;rsquo;t&amp;ndash;or won&amp;rsquo;t&amp;ndash;acknowledge the other&amp;rsquo;s issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recognize this is also the kind of story that can&amp;rsquo;t be told all the time in a flagship series like &lt;em&gt;Avengers&lt;/em&gt;, especially now in an era following the runaway success of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (and it&amp;rsquo;s at least in part because of the lack of such a franchise connection that allows this kind of story to flourish regularly in &lt;em&gt;Astro City&lt;/em&gt;) &amp;hellip; but I really am glad I picked this up back when it was released. Even if it did take me over a decade to really find solid enjoyment in it. What can I say? I should have paid better attention back in the early 2000s.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Daredevil 075</title>
      <link>https://brocktopus.github.io/longbox/post/Daredevil-075/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 22 Nov 2016 23:23:57 -0500</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://brocktopus.github.io/longbox/post/Daredevil-075/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Daredevil is a character I&amp;rsquo;ve always thought was great, and this volume (running from roughly 1998-2011 or so?) is absolutely &lt;em&gt;incredible&lt;/em&gt;. A blind superhero whose existence is anathema to his sworn profession as a lawyer? Sign me up. Oh, he&amp;rsquo;s also a Catholic? and wants to protect his &lt;em&gt;neighborhood&lt;/em&gt; rather than the world? Yeah, this is the recipe for an amazing comic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I happened to begin picking up this particular series when Brian Bendis took over on issue 26, and I followed it for several years (until the mid-60s issues) and have been trying to complete the run since then.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bendis&amp;rsquo; &lt;em&gt;Daredevil&lt;/em&gt; run is arguably the best that the character&amp;rsquo;s ever had. I know a lot of people point to Frank Miller, who really did do an admirable job shifting the focus of the comic toward gritty crime and personal angst, but Bendis cranked that shit up to 11 and broke off the knob.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bendis has always been best when writing crime or street-level action, and his pairing with Alex Maleev through this run hit all the high notes one might expect: the protagonist&amp;rsquo;s life is ruined in a number of baffling and suspenseful ways (with the FBI coloring in a Daredevil mask over a photo of Matt&amp;rsquo;s face successfully blowing my mind the first time I read it), there are numerous brutal brawls depicted, and everyone engages in believable&amp;ndash;if somewhat abundant&amp;ndash;dialogue. (The biggest downside to Bendis&amp;rsquo; approach to this comic is that it paved the way for significant &amp;ldquo;decompression&amp;rdquo; of story arcs stretched across numerous comic issues in anticipation of eventual trade collections.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cover to issue 075 is mostly stark white, with a rough cross shape painted in black and red (making the silhouette of Daredevil&amp;rsquo;s mask and eye slots visible in its form) next to a black-and-red phrase that also displays the silhouette in its space: &amp;ldquo;Thou shall not KILL&amp;rdquo; it reads, with the first three words in type and &amp;ldquo;KILL&amp;rdquo; in scrawled or brushed script. Along the top of the page, just under the &lt;em&gt;Daredevil&lt;/em&gt; logo, are the words &amp;ldquo;Decalogue Part V.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;https://brocktopus.github.io/longbox/img/Daredevil-075.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Cover to Daredevil 075, described above&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Daredevil issue 075&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This issue serves as the finale to the &amp;ldquo;Decalogue&amp;rdquo; storyline, which involves a church support group meeting to discuss the impact Daredevil&amp;rsquo;s had on their lives&amp;ndash;as well as their potential interaction with some seemingly demonic entity. In the previous issues, everyone goes around the room, alternating between telling their stories and arguing about the relevance or significance of their experiences. At the end of issue 74, one of the group members&amp;ndash;the slimiest and most obviously suspicious one&amp;ndash;points out that Matt Murdock has been sitting among them, seemingly able to mask his presence from everyone. They all freak out, naturally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s important to mention that, at this point in the overall run, Matt&amp;rsquo;s identity as Daredevil is &amp;ldquo;public&amp;rdquo; in the sense that the press&amp;ndash;via an FBI agent contact&amp;ndash;claimed he was Daredevil, and he prepared for the case. It was dropped, however, when the Kingpin murdered the newspaper&amp;rsquo;s owner. Not long afterward, Daredevil savagely beat up the Kingpin in public and declared &lt;em&gt;himself&lt;/em&gt; the new kingpin of Hell&amp;rsquo;s Kitchen while standing over the Kingpin&amp;rsquo;s unconscious body.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A year or so has passed in-story since that happened. One might imagine that the residents of Hell&amp;rsquo;s Kitchen would be a little freaked out about such an individual in their midst. One would be correct.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Matt reveals that he&amp;rsquo;s been tracking a presence of some kind that he first encountered when fighting laughable rogue The Jester, who acted strangely and vomited out a weird being that resembled a fetus with an ugly monster face. (Despite how disgusting it is, the shot of the Jester vomiting out the creature is top-notch.) This being would later find and inhabit another individual.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The suspicious member of the church group, a man named Lawrence, supposedly sold the being to the Jester as a source of mystical power, having learned the trick from some martial arts school that had fallen far out of favor. It turns out that now &lt;em&gt;he&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/em&gt; the one with the being inside him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Matt chased down Lawrence, who fled the group, but he was unable to stop Lawrence from killing himself&amp;ndash;and the being&amp;ndash;with a gun. Returning to the group, Matt let them know what had happened and that now they all had the closure they sought. He also noted that he was not so concerned about his identity being revealed because he figured he would die before completing the work he wanted to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Visually, this comic is so ridiculously impressive. I have loved every bit of art from Alex Maleev I&amp;rsquo;ve ever seen, and he has a knack for interpreting Bendis&amp;rsquo; scripts to really successful effect. Some people hate the technique he and other artists use to repeat certain images to suggest someone has been talking for a long time, but for Bendis&amp;rsquo; dialogue it works so well. (There&amp;rsquo;s just a lot of it!) Further, his representations of Daredevil&amp;rsquo;s fights look real and nasty and painful to engage in. Matt&amp;rsquo;s fighting style looks like the style of someone who grew up learning boxing, even if it&amp;rsquo;s mixed now with a lot of eastern martial arts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;Decalogue&amp;rdquo; is the penultimate arc, I think, for Bendis&amp;rsquo; run, and the whole thing is an absurdly enjoyable and suspenseful roller coaster. No one has turned Matt&amp;rsquo;s life upside-down more fully (and yes, I have not forgotten Miller&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Born Again&amp;rdquo; arc) and put him in increasingly worse/shitty situations where he acts out to realize the worst possible outcome of these situations. It&amp;rsquo;s long form cinematic drama in the best sense, and I make sure to re-read this run once or twice a year.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Green Lanterns 007</title>
      <link>https://brocktopus.github.io/longbox/post/Green-Lanterns-007/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 21 Nov 2016 11:16:26 -0500</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://brocktopus.github.io/longbox/post/Green-Lanterns-007/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I think that this might be the newest of all the comics I&amp;rsquo;ve reviewed so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Green Lanterns&lt;/em&gt; is a series starring Simon Baz and Jessica Cruz, two novice members of the Green Lantern Corps, each saddled with their own hang-ups about being a hero. They were paired up by Hal Jordan and tasked with protecting Earth while he went out into outer space to locate the rest of the Green Lantern Corps (as they had gone missing at the time). Also, like any good buddy cop story, the two despise each other at first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So the first arc of &lt;em&gt;Green Lanterns&lt;/em&gt; does a pretty respectable job of following Simon and Jessica through their trials of overcoming self-doubt, an irritating partner, and a potential invasion of earth by the Red Lanterns. This issue marks the beginning of a new story arc (and the denouement to the previous arc), so we get to see what the next phase of the protagonists&amp;rsquo; relationship looks like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cover to &lt;em&gt;Green Lanterns&lt;/em&gt; 007 features Simon and Jessica standing next to one another, in their uniforms, in front of a series of floating GL insignias. Simon holds his ring hand in front of him while Jessica raises hers high above her head.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;https://brocktopus.github.io/longbox/img/Green-Lanterns-007.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Cover to Green Lanterns 007, described above&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Green Lanterns issue 007&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The issue, set on Halloween, begins with a focus on Jessica&amp;rsquo;s perspective, coming to grips with being a GL and having to spend time with Simon&amp;rsquo;s family. In a pretty funny move, she bails out of family activities (readying treats for Halloween), claiming to herself that she&amp;rsquo;s not a people person, and instead tries to &amp;ldquo;find Darkseid and see what he&amp;rsquo;s doing for dinner,&amp;rdquo; even going so far as to ask her ring to call him (the ring: &amp;ldquo;Call sent to voice mail.&amp;rdquo;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, Simon catches her and begs for her help dealing with his family&amp;ndash;it&amp;rsquo;s clear that they have that much in common&amp;ndash;and the two do some baking as a way to contribute to the household and get to know one another better. There&amp;rsquo;s a nice chiasmus where Simon decides to bail on the baking (it&amp;rsquo;s not &amp;ldquo;perfect&amp;rdquo; the way his mother makes it), and it becomes Jessica&amp;rsquo;s turn to talk her partner down from doing something stupid. After Simon explains his relationship with his mother to Jessica, the two have an epiphany to cook with the aid of their power rings (allowing them to multitask much more easily).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Bonus: after revealing himself as a GL to his mom, Simon convinces her to try a cookie &amp;hellip; and she doesn&amp;rsquo;t hate it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During all of this, Farid (Simon&amp;rsquo;s nephew) has been screwing around with Rami, a Guardian of Oa hiding out in the family&amp;rsquo;s attic. Rami senses that some threat (revealed to be the Dominators) is coming, and &lt;em&gt;he&lt;/em&gt; bails from the house. The two GLs recognize they need to go after him, and fast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, this issue is pretty solid in terms of character development. Action-wise, it&amp;rsquo;s very &amp;ldquo;boring,&amp;rdquo; but in the context of the preceding six issues, it&amp;rsquo;s a really enjoyable moment of rest. There had been a &lt;em&gt;lot&lt;/em&gt; of action in those issues focusing on the problems that Jessica and Simon each felt about their ability to be a hero, and the interaction between them&amp;ndash;and the rest of Simon&amp;rsquo;s family&amp;ndash;here becomes a useful and satisfying progression from their overcoming some of those problems in their fight against the Red Lanterns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I was not initially sold on Simon Baz as a GL (because he used a gun! which I still think is kind of a lame early gimmick), I have come to really enjoy the presentation of his character in this series. I think that he works well with Jessica&amp;ndash;a character I wasn&amp;rsquo;t well-versed in before this series&amp;ndash;to give the GL franchise a pairing that feels fresh and innovative. (I mean, as iconic as Hal Jordan is, it&amp;rsquo;s not really that fascinating to watch a guy who believes, and often proves, he can do anything he wants.) Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s just the longtime Marvel fan in me, but the relatability of Simon &amp;amp; Jessica as heroes-who-don&amp;rsquo;t-always-think-they-live-up-to-the-role really do a lot to make this series.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Astro City 024</title>
      <link>https://brocktopus.github.io/longbox/post/Astro-City-024/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 17 Nov 2016 18:50:22 -0500</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://brocktopus.github.io/longbox/post/Astro-City-024/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;While Green Lantern remains perhaps my favorite character-specific franchise, &lt;em&gt;Astro City&lt;/em&gt; is far and away my single favorite series, ever. It is superhero comics world-building done expertly, pulling together and twisting tropes in a way that has not been done as fully, consistently, or enjoyably by anyone else. Kurt Busiek has it all together here and presents it in full force with Alex Ross covers and (usually) Brent Anderson art.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Astro City&lt;/em&gt; is a comic whose stories focus on the titular city (located on the west coast, standing in the place of San Francisco or Seattle), which is populated by more than a century of superhero history. There&amp;rsquo;s an homage or parody to pretty much every superhero type; the very first issue provides an incredible Superman tale via the stand-in Samaritan, the greatest storyline in the title involves a Batman and Robin pair, there&amp;rsquo;s a wisecracking acrobat who annoys &lt;em&gt;everyone&lt;/em&gt; he runs into or teams up with, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This issue, in the third (current) volume, focuses on a talking gorilla from the fabled antarctic Gorilla Mountain. Yes, that&amp;rsquo;s right. What does the gorilla&amp;ndash;who goes by the name &amp;ldquo;Sticks&amp;rdquo; (a nickname for his drumming and because his original name was apparently &amp;ldquo;Stekk&amp;rdquo;)&amp;ndash;want to do with his life? Play music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The previous issue detailed his initial arrival in Astro City, trying out for a band, and getting caught up in the world of superheroics (after all, he&amp;rsquo;s a talking gorilla! and he has some military training from the Gorilla Mountain forces).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cover features Sticks in action, fangs bared, arms raised, and drumsticks in hand(s) as he&amp;rsquo;s in the middle of &lt;em&gt;pounding&lt;/em&gt; on a drum set (whose bass drum features the iconic Astro City &amp;ldquo;rocket&amp;rdquo; icon). An explosion of purple and green motion lines suggest this is a snapshot of an incredibly wild performance.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;https://brocktopus.github.io/longbox/img/Astro-City-024.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Cover to Astro City 024, described above&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Astro City issue 024&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In this issue, we learn about Sticks&amp;rsquo; past&amp;ndash;why he left Gorilla Mountain and how it&amp;rsquo;s impacted his decision to try being a superhero, since he fits in more easily with them than with the average Astro City resident.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the while, Sticks struggles with doing the right thing and &lt;em&gt;wanting&lt;/em&gt; to do the right thing, namely whether or not he should be a superhero just because he can, or if it&amp;rsquo;s better left to those with the drive to pursue it. As he states in a thought/narrative caption: &amp;ldquo;It takes the right kind of &lt;strong&gt;person&lt;/strong&gt; to do this kind of thing. To make it their life, their &lt;strong&gt;mission&lt;/strong&gt;.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Naturally, he quits and reconnects with his old bandmates. Unfortunately, they don&amp;rsquo;t all agree on whether or not to keep associating with Sticks; after all, as a talking gorilla, he draws attention by super-villains and that could be dangerous for his friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While he&amp;rsquo;s understandable about it, Sticks is nonetheless hurt, and it shows (there&amp;rsquo;s something a bit astounding about feeling a sympathetic connection to a gorilla in a t-shirt). While he sits on a roof at night, Samaritan comes to visit and offers the sort of advice that the best Superman stories always allow him to provide: genuine empathy and consideration that lead toward an optimistic future always left in the listener&amp;rsquo;s hands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Samaritan acknowledges Sticks doesn&amp;rsquo;t want to be a superhero and doesn&amp;rsquo;t try to convince him otherwise. Instead, he demonstrates that he believes &amp;ldquo;There&amp;rsquo;s a way. There&amp;rsquo;s &lt;strong&gt;always&lt;/strong&gt; a way. I &lt;strong&gt;believe&lt;/strong&gt; that. Don&amp;rsquo;t &lt;strong&gt;give up&lt;/strong&gt;. Find a way to do what you love. If I can help, you can call on me. I&amp;rsquo;ll give you an alert code. But find a &lt;strong&gt;way&lt;/strong&gt;.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How much more of a &lt;em&gt;samaritan&lt;/em&gt; can one be, if not to help lift up another and assist them toward their goals?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sticks decides to take on the temporary identity of &amp;ldquo;Tuxedo Gorilla&amp;rdquo; in order to make a few higher-profile busts to draw the press so that he can make an announcement: he&amp;rsquo;s having auditions for a super-powered band. His superhero contacts provide security so that no one can disrupt the proceedings (including blocking any sensors attempting to learn the secret identities of auditioners), and he manages to get together a group that have music-oriented abilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a record contract ready, Sticks and company decide to record some tricks and &amp;ldquo;fight a little crime along the way&amp;rdquo; as the group &lt;em&gt;Powerchord&lt;/em&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it&amp;rsquo;s fair to say that I love every issue of &lt;em&gt;Astro City&lt;/em&gt;, and this is no different. Sticks&amp;rsquo; story is a fantastic origin tale and an accessible jumping-on point for new readers (well, assuming they read issue 023 first). There are so many clear nods to existing comic characters and ideas&amp;ndash;most obviously being Gorilla Mountain&amp;rsquo;s debt to Gorilla City from &lt;em&gt;The Flash&lt;/em&gt;&amp;ndash;and they&amp;rsquo;re all taken in really interesting and new directions while feeling familiar or comfortable in the best way(s).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If I could only read one comic series from this point forward, it would be &lt;em&gt;Astro City&lt;/em&gt;, without question. And I would stand by that decision happily.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Doctor Strange 072</title>
      <link>https://brocktopus.github.io/longbox/post/Doctor-Strange-072/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 15 Nov 2016 22:44:05 -0500</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://brocktopus.github.io/longbox/post/Doctor-Strange-072/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;First, a note: my random number generator seems to keep pointing me to issues numbering in the 70s. An interesting trend so far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay, so, more Doctor Strange! And this time, it&amp;rsquo;s from the 1970s-80s series (a predecessor to the series discussed in my earlier Doctor Strange review).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cover to &lt;em&gt;Doctor Strange&lt;/em&gt; #072 shows Doctor Strange, with an absolutely &lt;em&gt;metal&lt;/em&gt; beard, wrapped in the tentacles of some green Lovecraftian creature whose limbs and cilia are writhing about. Doctor Strange gestures with one hand to fire some pink energy at his opponent.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;https://brocktopus.github.io/longbox/img/Doctor-Strange-072.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Cover to Doctor Strange 072, described above&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Doctor Strange issue 072&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The story apparently starts in the Dark Dimension, or some related dimension, as we learn that Umar (Dormammu&amp;rsquo;s sister) is extracting tribute (aka taxes) in the form of mystic energy from her subjects. Technically, her tax collectors are doing this, on a platform in a public square that looks like it doubles as a French Revolution-era guillotine stage.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doctor Strange has the best cloak/robe I&amp;rsquo;ve ever seen him in (as he&amp;rsquo;s undercover or otherwise incognito, it appears), and&amp;ndash;again&amp;ndash;his hair looks &lt;em&gt;dope as hell&lt;/em&gt;. I don&amp;rsquo;t want to understate this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, Doctor Strange and a handful of rebels storm the tax collector&amp;rsquo;s stage and collect the paid tributes (which have been condensed into small orbs or coins). Naturally, the citizens are a little pissed. There&amp;rsquo;s a really disturbing coincidental parallel to recent affairs, I think. Consider this exchange:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Doctor Strange&lt;/strong&gt;: &amp;ldquo;Your rebellion&amp;rsquo;s public support is still somewhat lacking.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rahl (a rebel)&lt;/strong&gt;: &amp;ldquo;I know. The problem is that Umar has made herself appear benevolent and gracious to the people of the Dark Dimension. And after her brother&amp;rsquo;s reign of terror, there&amp;rsquo;s an illusion of good feeling in the realm. Things seem better to those who enjoy full citizenship, and so they&amp;rsquo;re afraid to support us. They fear that things might go back to the way they were!&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Doctor Strange&lt;/strong&gt;: &amp;ldquo;Then your most urgent goal is to get the people to see Umar for what she really is.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, this goal is punctuated by an immediate need to fight some Mindless Ones, so at least there&amp;rsquo;s no shortage of magical combat for the reader uninterested in interdimensional politics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unrelated: the password chosen by Clea for entry into the rebels&amp;rsquo; stronghold is &amp;ldquo;Yo, Adriene &amp;hellip; it&amp;rsquo;s me, Rocky!&amp;rdquo; because&amp;ndash;according to Clea&amp;ndash;she chose an Earth-based pop culture reference (&amp;ldquo;things I remembered from your television, Stephen&amp;rdquo;) with the assumption that Umar&amp;rsquo;s subjects would never be able to guess it. I&amp;rsquo;ll admit that I&amp;rsquo;m shocked Doctor Strange has a television. I mean, he seems the type who&amp;rsquo;d be just snobby enough to pride himself in not watching TV and instead getting news updates and whatever from benevolent imp messengers or something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, back on Earth, apparently Wong has to shut down the advances of Sara, an attractive girl who appears to be trying her best to engage Wong in a genuine relationship despite his unnerving dedication to being Doctor Strange&amp;rsquo;s manservant. (I mean, surely the good doctor would &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; his closest friend and companion to seek out intimate companionship, right?!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, we&amp;rsquo;re only halfway through this story, and I have no clue what&amp;rsquo;s going to happen next. I&amp;rsquo;m excited to see what happens.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, Umar does her best, and fails, to spy on Strange through scrying magics. She does at least have a minor epiphany that he may be &lt;em&gt;anywhere&lt;/em&gt;, including in her own dimension.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doctor Strange and Rahl go to visit the prisoner Orini&amp;ndash;Clea&amp;rsquo;s father, and Umar loyalist? I admit I am unfamiliar with this character&amp;ndash;and Strange uses the Eye of Agamotto to magically coerce Orini to give up the secrets of Umar&amp;rsquo;s army. Also, we learn the shocking revelation that Clea&amp;rsquo;s mother is Umar herself, having slept with Orini and abandoned the baby with him after Clea&amp;rsquo;s birth. Naturally, Clea is a bit taken aback by this when Strange informs her of the news.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the rebels decide to storm one of Umar&amp;rsquo;s caravans (which looks &lt;em&gt;hilarious&lt;/em&gt; as an Oregon Trail-style wagon train with giant lizard beasts of burden and moving along on a Ditkoesque floating pathway), Clea frees her father to have a conversation with him as parent and child. He promptly beats the hell out of her, or so we&amp;rsquo;re supposed to assume.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, there is an &lt;strong&gt;awesome&lt;/strong&gt; mystical moment where a caravan guard throws a canvas that, as it unfurls, opens a &amp;ldquo;portable warp&amp;rdquo; through which emerges a creature&amp;ndash;I&amp;rsquo;m guessing the monster from the cover&amp;ndash;that has a sharp beak and looks a lot like the alien from &lt;em&gt;Watchmen&lt;/em&gt; sans eye.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Doctor Strange tries to intervene and help the rebels, he is pulled &amp;hellip; somewhere else (it&amp;rsquo;s hard to say, since the background is all black) &amp;hellip; by &amp;ldquo;the outcasts,&amp;rdquo; creatures of various species, or so I gather (they have different hands/limbs, but we can&amp;rsquo;t see any of their facial features), who want to keep themselves hidden from Umar. When Strange says he wants to help regardless, they let him know it&amp;rsquo;s too late&amp;ndash;the rebels have fallen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a second cliffhanger moment, Orini arrives at Umar&amp;rsquo;s palace, bringing an unconscious Clea to his former lover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This story was dope, and is packed with some essential Doctor Strange plot tropes as well as moving along some character development for Clea and the residents of the Dark Dimension in general. I really wish Doctor Strange grew his hair out this way in the comics&amp;ndash;it really adds some metal/punk aesthetic to a character that is so often depicted as being very conservative in personal style, even despite the focus of his life&amp;rsquo;s work.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Marvel Comics Presents 072</title>
      <link>https://brocktopus.github.io/longbox/post/Marvel-Comics-Presents-072/</link>
      <pubDate>Thu, 10 Nov 2016 17:33:46 -0500</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://brocktopus.github.io/longbox/post/Marvel-Comics-Presents-072/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Marvel Comics Presents&lt;/em&gt; (or &lt;em&gt;MCP&lt;/em&gt;) is a series that interested me for the longest time: it was an anthology comic that tended to have four stories (each 8 pages) of varying length, by which I mean that one story might have 8-10 parts, another might have 4-6, another might only be a single 8-page story, and so on. So a reader was likely to get some really fascinating story turnover in any given collection of issues. When I was young, &lt;em&gt;MCP&lt;/em&gt; introduced me to some characters that I don&amp;rsquo;t think I ever would have checked out otherwise, most notably (for me) Shang-Chi, but also minor characters like Stingray or the Collective Man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The primary story of many &lt;em&gt;MCP&lt;/em&gt; issues featured Wolverine&amp;ndash;unsurprising, given his ability to sell pretty much any comic where he appeared on the cover. &lt;em&gt;MCP&lt;/em&gt; 072, however, is important because it begins the tale of an incredibly significant part of Wolverine&amp;rsquo;s backstory, written &amp;amp; drawn by Barry Windsor-Smith: the Weapon X experiments that bonded adamantium to his skeleton.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cover for issue 072, like all of the &lt;em&gt;MCP&lt;/em&gt; covers, is wraparound, with the primary (Wolverine) story featured on the front and the characters of the other three stories&amp;ndash;Daredevil, Shanna the She-Devil, and Red Wolf&amp;ndash;on the back. On the front half, Wolverine stands, the right half of his body covered by his classic brown-and-yellow suit, and his left half naked with a number of protruding spikes in preparation for his adamantium injections. Behind him is a large skull (likely his own), with similar spikes. Flames beneath a blank blue canvas comprise the background, layered (from top down) yellow, orange, and red. At the top of the page, below the comic&amp;rsquo;s title/logo, are the words: &amp;ldquo;Before Wolverine there was Weapon X.&amp;rdquo; On the back half of the cover, Shanna is posed crouching (with a caption box that declares &amp;ldquo;Her &lt;strong&gt;jungle&lt;/strong&gt; reeks of &lt;strong&gt;evil&lt;/strong&gt;, and SHANNA must &lt;strong&gt;confront&lt;/strong&gt; it.&amp;ldquo;), while Red Wolf leaps behind her, up and to her left (captioned &amp;ldquo;RED WOLF &lt;strong&gt;faces&lt;/strong&gt; the &lt;strong&gt;death&lt;/strong&gt; of his &lt;strong&gt;partner Lobo&lt;/strong&gt;!&amp;ldquo;). Behind her, down and to the right, Daredevil similarly jumps forward, swinging his billy club (caption: &amp;ldquo;DAREDEVIL is &lt;strong&gt;helpless&lt;/strong&gt; when things come to a &lt;strong&gt;head&lt;/strong&gt; in &lt;strong&gt;New York&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;rdquo;). What appears to be the back side of the large skull from the front cover looms behind the figures.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;https://brocktopus.github.io/longbox/img/Marvel-Comics-Presents-072.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Cover to Marvel Comics Presents 072, described above&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Marvel Comics Presents issue 072&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The &amp;ldquo;Weapon X&amp;rdquo; story in this issue must have been &lt;em&gt;ridiculously&lt;/em&gt; confusing to everyone when it initially came out, since it consists of three threads: (1) Wolverine down on his luck in the Yukon, drinking and getting in fights; (2) flashes of the Weapon X experiments themselves, provided without explanation/context; (3) panels of a scientist performing some sort of experiment that may or may not be (but almost certainly is) related to the Weapon X project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t actually pick up this issue until last year, but I already knew the general beats to this story. I have to say, in its serialized form, I&amp;rsquo;m a bit disappointed since there&amp;rsquo;s no real room for anything to breathe here (although I get that BWS is trying to let things unfold in a somewhat-similar manner to Logan&amp;rsquo;s ability to comprehend what happened to him). The art style and the narration is solid&amp;ndash;it does its job of leaving me wanting more. I&amp;rsquo;m just torn in both wanting more and not feeling like I really had &amp;ldquo;enough&amp;rdquo; in this portion to really enjoy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Shanna comic provided is part 5 of its story. I&amp;rsquo;m stoked going in because there&amp;rsquo;s Paul Gulacy art&amp;ndash;which I know is not everyone&amp;rsquo;s cup of tea but he is great at &amp;ldquo;realistic&amp;rdquo; comic stories (such as his run on &lt;em&gt;Master of Kung Fu&lt;/em&gt;) so I&amp;rsquo;m expecting strong work here. Shanna and some others are tracking diamond smugglers and poachers through/near Tanzania. This part of the story does a really successful job at showing the violence and tragedy that accompanies such acts, and the cliffhanger&amp;ndash;where Shanna discovers someone (a local?) buried up to his neck amid massive anthills&amp;ndash;is creepy and suspenseful. Unlike with the Wolverine story, I have a clear sense of where this is going (without bringing in retrospective knowledge of the overall plot).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In contrast, I don&amp;rsquo;t really know how to explain the Daredevil component (it&amp;rsquo;s part 4 and the final part, apparently, of a story). There&amp;rsquo;s apparently been a heat weave, and tensions are running high as people get frustrated. A woman named Ms. Pinkwater, whose defining feature is a Carmen Sandiego hat, is doing &amp;hellip; something? I can&amp;rsquo;t really figure it out. Anyway, apparently a bunch of people hold hands and sing or something, and it causes rain to fall and all tensions in the city to relax. Daredevil doesn&amp;rsquo;t really do anything other than read a handwritten note that asks him not to do anything. What the hell?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Red Wolf story&amp;ndash;which I think is a standalone story&amp;ndash;is equally weak. Red Wolf begins in a lodge, ruminating on the loss of his wolf partner Lobo, while a truck full of drunks look for something to hunt. They eventually discover a mother wolf feeding her cubs and proceed to kill almost all of them (save one), when Red Wolf finally acts. Even then, he&amp;rsquo;s nearly taken out until one of the hunters decides they&amp;rsquo;ve gone too far and has a standoff with his buddy. Red Wolf, meanwhile, takes the surviving cub (presumably to raise himself).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All in all, this issue is a decent representative for &lt;em&gt;MCP&lt;/em&gt; in general: there&amp;rsquo;s some interesting experimentation happening and some solid, compelling story work &amp;hellip; but there are also stinkers that don&amp;rsquo;t feel really worthwhile or well-realized. Does the former cancel out the latter? Yes and no&amp;ndash;certainly enough, for me, to not absolutely hate the series, but not so much that I forget nostalgia is a big part of my enjoyment of this series.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Animal Man 076</title>
      <link>https://brocktopus.github.io/longbox/post/Animal-Man-076/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 06 Nov 2016 23:13:26 -0500</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://brocktopus.github.io/longbox/post/Animal-Man-076/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The first Vertigo post for this blog is also the first &lt;em&gt;Animal Man&lt;/em&gt; post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ahh, Animal Man. Such a great character raised out of mediocre beginnings. Without getting &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; mired in details, it&amp;rsquo;s enough to say that Buddy Baker&amp;ndash;Animal Man&amp;ndash;can tap into the abilities of animals and make use thereof to fight injustice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, unlike most superheroes, he has a family (a wife, Ellen, and two children, Cliff and Maxine). This is important, because the central conflict in Buddy&amp;rsquo;s life is the tug-of-war that &lt;em&gt;constantly&lt;/em&gt; occurs between his desire to live a normal life with his family and his desire to use his powers in the best and most effective way possible (often to try and raise awareness about animal rights and ecological issues). This tug-of-war has led Buddy to some interesting places (for the reader, at least; it&amp;rsquo;s pretty much ruined his life over and over again). At least, this is what happened to the character in the first volume of his own series; Grant Morrison set up this model and pretty much every author working on &lt;em&gt;Animal Man&lt;/em&gt; since has followed suit, although they may have tweaked some specifics here and there, like looking at how Ellen deals with her completely absurd life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At one point, Buddy went through a significant metamorphosis that left him in the body of a chimerical creature with the attributes of all kinds of animals, and he decided to use his new appearance to help found a church that would worship his daughter Maxine and her even-more-powerful animal-related powers&amp;ndash;the church is even called &amp;ldquo;The Life-Power Church of Maxine&amp;rdquo;&amp;ndash;set up half-seriously and half-deceptively by the Bakers and their closest friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cover to issue 076, then, shows Buddy in his animal-avatar form flying through a red sky over what appears to be the upraised arms/hands of an angry mob, given the tools and guns held aloft by those arms.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;https://brocktopus.github.io/longbox/img/Animal-Man-076.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Cover to Animal Man 076, described above&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Animal Man issue 076&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The story begins with several pages narrated via in-universe comics drawn by budding cartoonist Cliff Baker, who lets us know that the Life-Power Church is on its way to Montana in search of some promised land where people and animals can live in harmony. They&amp;rsquo;ve had to deal with some hunters and other critics along the way, though.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cartoon has been mailed to Ellen, who&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; with her family but instead with a small group of lesbian activists (that&amp;rsquo;s not a snarky, bigoted comment by me&amp;ndash;that&amp;rsquo;s how the characters were introduced and how they continue to be portrayed; a few issues before this one, Ellen notes to Buddy that she&amp;rsquo;s felt a connection growing between her and Sarah, one of the activists).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apparently the Life-Power Church is facing off against the National Guard in Nebraska (there&amp;rsquo;s references to a &amp;ldquo;plague&amp;rdquo; that has affected a number of people across the country, where they dream of themselves as animals running wild on human society), and Ellen&amp;rsquo;s conflicted between staying put with Sarah and being there in Nebraska for her family; the conversation in this scene does a pretty solid job of demonstrating various characters&amp;rsquo; takes on the situation so that no one seems to have the &amp;ldquo;best&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;most correct&amp;rdquo; answer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s an equally intriguing scene between Maxine and a follower of the LFC (Ray, given the Church name &amp;ldquo;Manta Ray&amp;rdquo;) who&amp;rsquo;s secretly a government agent awaiting the order to assassinate Maxine, Buddy, or both. But she finds herself questioning her ability to murder a child if so commanded when she takes an impromptu romp/bath in a nearby river with Maxine and a throng of animal companions/guards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ray&amp;rsquo;s plot intertwines with that of an older man named Jack who&amp;rsquo;s looking to save his son from the LFC cult. Ray ends up getting caught by some locals who decide to rape her in the corn fields. Jack saves her, figuring that she can&amp;rsquo;t have made any poor decisions (that is, it&amp;rsquo;s not her fault she was caught and is being tortured, it&amp;rsquo;s the Church&amp;rsquo;s) that his own son didn&amp;rsquo;t make.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Surprisingly(?), there&amp;rsquo;s very little Buddy himself in this issue &amp;hellip; but I don&amp;rsquo;t find myself disappointed by that fact. The overall story is really well fleshed out by the focus on these peripheral characters impacted by his actions from earlier issues. It really makes the world come alive in a way that you don&amp;rsquo;t get with close examinations of only a comic&amp;rsquo;s core characters. For example: we don&amp;rsquo;t ever really have that many opportunities for the development of peripheral characters in &lt;em&gt;Batman&lt;/em&gt; whose lives were affected by the actions of Batman or his rogues&amp;rsquo; gallery.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cable 011</title>
      <link>https://brocktopus.github.io/longbox/post/Cable-011/</link>
      <pubDate>Wed, 02 Nov 2016 19:58:43 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://brocktopus.github.io/longbox/post/Cable-011/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Today&amp;rsquo;s review features Cable, a character that, along with Deadpool, has somehow managed to survive the &amp;lsquo;90s boom that spawned him. I was never fully sold on the &lt;strong&gt;extreme&lt;/strong&gt; nature of the Liefeld X-Force, but I suppose I get why Cable remains interesting to many.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He was, for some time, the consummate 1980s action hero ideal, a &amp;ldquo;mystery man&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;tactical badass&amp;rdquo; that speaks directly to the fantasies of the stereotypical superhero comic consumer. Plus, he has a cool eye scar and a metal arm! (Ironically, I think the Magog design for &lt;em&gt;Kingdom Come&lt;/em&gt;, meant to play on all the Cable-era tropes that Waid &amp;amp; Ross hated, is much more awesome.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since his introduction, Cable&amp;rsquo;s been fleshed out a lot more, and the &lt;em&gt;Cable&lt;/em&gt; series that this issue (discussed more below) comes from has a really interesting initial story premise: Cable has to flee to the future with a special infant girl, who is supposed to one day be the mutant messiah, and he tries to keep her alive while mutant cop/ethnic cleanser Bishop chases them both through time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cover to &lt;em&gt;Cable&lt;/em&gt; #011 features an image of young Hope Summers in front of a white background, where she is dressed in an adorably ill-fitting X-Men uniform resembling Cable&amp;rsquo;s outfit (complete with giant shoulder pads) and wielding an oversized gun of some sort &amp;hellip; maybe a sawed-off gatling gun or something?&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;https://brocktopus.github.io/longbox/img/Cable-011.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Cover to Cable 011, described above&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Cable issue 011&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Okay, so when this issue begins, Cable has taken Hope (although in the comic Hope does not yet have a name) to an oasis-like settlement in a post-apocalyptic hellscape populated by vicious insectoid beings (called &amp;ldquo;the cockroach army&amp;rdquo; by Cable). Cable has a wife named Hope, met during one of the time-jumps made by Cable and the child he&amp;rsquo;s protecting, who ends up dying during a bandit attack, and so he names the child Hope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The remaining humans devise a bomb or gas or something to destroy the cockroaches, but Cable worries they&amp;rsquo;ll kill the humans too. So, he and Hope jump a hundred years into the future, surrounded by salt flats and human skeletons. The image (a two-page spread) is actually pretty incredible, the clean art style juxtaposed with the apocalyptic horror and Hope&amp;rsquo;s vomiting from the experience of sliding through time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unrelated: this issue, more than many before it in this series, really calls to mind the Futurama episode where Fry, Professor Farnsworth, and Bender use a time machine and witness the end of the universe. (Like the Futurama crew, Cable can only jump into the future.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think I enjoyed this series (picking up the first twenty or so issues from a dollar bin) in part because Cable is depicted stylistically so far from his Liefeld origins: no ludicrous thigh pouches, consistent realistic proportions, and his relationship with the child Hope is really believable: he&amp;rsquo;s clearly come around from seeing this as a duty put upon him to a genuine parental concern for her well-being. It&amp;rsquo;s like an X-Men version of &lt;em&gt;The Road&lt;/em&gt;, and I mean that as a compliment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On one page, there&amp;rsquo;s a moment that &lt;em&gt;has&lt;/em&gt; to be a reference to Philip K. Dick&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;The Second Variety&amp;rdquo;&amp;mdash;Cable hunts a wolf that turns out to be a machine with a wolf&amp;rsquo;s external appearance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I reread this issue, the focus on Cable and Hope is really quite enjoyable. The conflict is almost entirely on Cable trying to decide what sorts of details to tell Hope about the past and her potential destiny (along with details about child development and puberty) rather than on forcing gunfights and explosions and whatnot into the mix. There&amp;rsquo;s a lot of characterization here, and maybe it&amp;rsquo;s the sheer lack of possible distractions that has made it possible or my interest in depressing apocalyptic wasteland stories, but &amp;hellip; yeah, I dig this issue. This Cable is so much more interesting than when he was a mix of Kyle Reese and the Terminator but with no real backstory to lean on.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Master of Kung Fu 071</title>
      <link>https://brocktopus.github.io/longbox/post/Master-of-Kung-Fu-071/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 30 Oct 2016 23:21:15 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://brocktopus.github.io/longbox/post/Master-of-Kung-Fu-071/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Shang-Chi, the master of kung fu, is one of Marvel&amp;rsquo;s greatest martial arts characters, and one who was born during the company&amp;rsquo;s 1970s-era efforts to exploit the martial arts movie craze (although I admit I&amp;rsquo;m a bigger fan of Shang-Chi frenemy Shen Kuei, &amp;ldquo;the Cat&amp;rdquo;). This series is definitely a reflection of that time, and it&amp;rsquo;s Doug Moench&amp;rsquo;s magnum opus (although, sadly, this particular issue doesn&amp;rsquo;t feature Paul Gulacy, whose work meshed excellently with Moench, although the artist here, Mike Zeck, also does a solid job with the kung fu/espionage style the book goes for).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make the character&amp;rsquo;s world even more incredible, it&amp;rsquo;s filled with a cast of pulp homages: Shang-Chi&amp;rsquo;s father is Fu Manchu (although Marvel lost the rights to the character, so he&amp;rsquo;s not actually called that&amp;mdash;or any other&amp;mdash;name any more, instead referred to by vague descriptions), and Shang-Chi&amp;rsquo;s super-spy BFF, MI-6 agent Clive Reston, is &lt;em&gt;heavily implied&lt;/em&gt; to be the son of James Bond, while his mentor Sir Denis Nayland-Smith (an enemy of Fu Manchu&amp;rsquo;s) is suggested to be a relative of Sherlock Holmes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ok, so &lt;em&gt;MoKF&lt;/em&gt; 071. This issue has an incredible cover&amp;mdash;Shang-Chi is posed ready for a fight, barefoot and clad only in his red pants and bandana, in front of a giant yin-yang symbol. The background is also a massive jigsaw puzzle whose pieces begin to fall apart near the bottom of the image. (There&amp;rsquo;s a jigsaw motif running through this issue, just FYI.)&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;https://brocktopus.github.io/longbox/img/Master-of-Kung-Fu-071.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Cover to Master of Kung Fu 071, described above&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Master of Kung Fu issue 071&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The issue opens with a fantastic two-page spread wherein Shang-Chi recaps a bunch of recent storylines, all laid out as interlocking jigsaw pieces. The next several pages explore Shang-Chi&amp;rsquo;s coming to terms with various close relationships (a love interest, Juliette; even more intense and long-term love interest, Leiko Wu; and BFF Clive Reston) and the changes that had occurred in regards to each.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Naturally, this issue then segues into a conversation scene while Shang-Chi and Leiko (who&amp;rsquo;s been putting together a jigsaw puzzle of a yin-yang symbol) share a pizza. After they eat, they visit a martial arts studio and engage in a friendly bout to exercise &amp;amp; train, making an impressive enough showing that all the other individuals present stop to watch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After they go to a movie and return home, the comic ends on a cliffhanger where a battered Sir Denis bursts into their home, seeking help with supposed corruption in the MI-6 agency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s not a tremendous amount of action in this comic, but that&amp;rsquo;s not necessarily a bad thing. Shang-Chi has always been depicted as an extremely introspective character who seeks a path to enlightenment and peace with every action he takes and every phenomenon he witnesses. That he reflects on a number of the major plots in the comic so far is a totally human move (in addition to having the practical effect of catching up newer readers to the series&amp;rsquo; progression). I found myself nodding along, persuaded by Shang-Chi&amp;rsquo;s line of reasoning as he attempted to make sense of the insanity that is life in a pulp comic book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Master of Kung Fu&lt;/em&gt; is a series that I try to collect through dollar bins; I know that Marvel has recently begun reprinting the series in massive omnibus form, but, given its content and focus, the comic really seems best experienced when one is exposed to the feel and smell of crappy older comic paper. It just seems appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Doom Patrol 041 (1987)</title>
      <link>https://brocktopus.github.io/longbox/post/Doom-Patrol-041/</link>
      <pubDate>Tue, 25 Oct 2016 23:51:07 -0400</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://brocktopus.github.io/longbox/post/Doom-Patrol-041/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I didn&amp;rsquo;t quite expect an issue of &lt;em&gt;Doom Patrol&lt;/em&gt; to appear so soon, but here we are. Possibly the single greatest comic run I own, by the author whose work(s) I try to follow more than any other (Grant Morrison). (As an aside, I had the help of a friend in completing this run some time ago, and I am reminded that I still need to pay her back for her help in doing so.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Doom Patrol, as characters, have always fascinated me in the way that the X-Men tend to for most readers. They&amp;rsquo;re outcasts who fight against the banality of the status quo and champion individuals and groups on the margins of society. Of course, the original Doom Patrol team managed to out-hero the X-Men by giving their lives for a small fishing village. And the characters stayed dead for some time! (This is unheard of in comics, unless you were Ben Parker or Bucky Barnes &amp;hellip; at least until the early 2000s.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, having Grant Morrison provide his take on the Doom Patrol is/was positively awesome, especially since this take involves surrealism, dada, comics deconstructionism, and a fundamental plot-line later ripped off by M. Night Shyamalan for his movie &lt;em&gt;Unbreakable&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cover to &lt;em&gt;Doom Patrol&lt;/em&gt; 041, by Simon Bisley (I think? I feel pretty sure about this, since he loves to do hyper-detailed elbows), is suitable for the comic: there&amp;rsquo;s a naked, faceless woman (a character named Rhea, who appears within the issue) floating above a naked, muscular humanoid with a tail and visible spine nearly protruding through its skin. To the right of these figures are various skulls and skeletal limbs; at least one of the skulls appears to be screwed or bolted to some mechanical/industrial apparatus.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;https://brocktopus.github.io/longbox/img/Doom-Patrol-041.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Cover to Doom Patrol 041, described above&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;h4&gt;Doom Patrol issue 041&lt;/h4&gt;
        
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;So, the issue begins in a typically cryptic Morrison way, with a woman visiting &amp;ldquo;one of the five&amp;rdquo; lost and found offices that are special in some way. They contain lost memories, confidences, innocence, etc. The woman visiting the office is looking for Flex Mentallo, a comic character lost since the 1950s. I love Flex Mentallo, so I&amp;rsquo;m stoked to see if he makes an appearance in this issue, although his &amp;ldquo;first appearance&amp;rdquo; doesn&amp;rsquo;t actually occur until the next issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Robotman is in his &amp;ldquo;spider legs&amp;rdquo; phase in this issue, which was another neat twist on the character&amp;mdash;I liked this aesthetic more than his giant shoulder-pads during this run. I always appreciated Robotman for his sleek look; the shoulders scream &amp;lsquo;90s and it&amp;rsquo;s just not a great look. That said, I do appreciate that it&amp;rsquo;s a kind of expression of his efforts to find a personal style, since he&amp;rsquo;s basically a disembodied brain in a mobile tin can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The plot of this issue is a climax to a multi-issue storyline. Here, the anathematicians face off against the agent of the kaleidoscope in a battle of &lt;em&gt;potlatch&lt;/em&gt; (having had the concept introduced to them by the Negative Man) wherein they take turns destroying more and more important &amp;amp; valuable symbols of their ideologies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Robotman, on the advice of Rhea, plants a flower and a giant angel (in the form of a massive rock with three or more human faces on which sits a city) comes to life and is apparently named Balzizras. It had created a world devoid of creativity, being able to imagine only simple conflict between those warring ideologies. Now, the flower allows for free imagination: &amp;ldquo;The creator&amp;rsquo;s come down &lt;strong&gt;among&lt;/strong&gt; you, not as a &lt;strong&gt;judge&lt;/strong&gt;, but as a sort of imaginative energy. Pretty neat, huh?&amp;rdquo; When Robotman asks if it&amp;rsquo;s really an angel, Rhea replies: &amp;ldquo;Well, it&amp;rsquo;s either &lt;strong&gt;that&lt;/strong&gt; or the psychic projection of a woman called &lt;strong&gt;Ilse Krauss&lt;/strong&gt; who&amp;rsquo;s lying in a hospital bed in &lt;strong&gt;Bremen&lt;/strong&gt;, dying of brain cancer. It&amp;rsquo;s hard to be sure.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is the kind of concept that I &lt;em&gt;love&lt;/em&gt; reading about in comics. Morrison knows exactly how to tap into the part of my brain that drinks in the most incredible high-concept ideas spitballed in half-formed states, since they allow the reader the opportunity to imagine how the ideas might be realized. The conflict is resolved by heroes who are willing to consider completely absurd and seemingly unrelated solutions, and the payoffs are frequently not returns to the status quo but radical paradigm shifts in which the characters (and the reader, hopefully?) develop further via the enlightenment they&amp;rsquo;ve gained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pretty much every storyline in Morrison&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Doom Patrol&lt;/em&gt; run achieves this without disappointing; the same can be said of his &lt;em&gt;JLA&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Animal Man&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;All-Star Superman&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;New X-Men&lt;/em&gt; runs (maybe not quite to this extent with &lt;em&gt;New X-Men&lt;/em&gt;, perhaps). It&amp;rsquo;s this desire to use the superhero mythos as a way to promote internal philosophical development on the part of the reader that makes me appreciate Morrison&amp;rsquo;s writing. Sure, it&amp;rsquo;s interesting when superheroes are taken seriously (a la &lt;em&gt;Watchmen&lt;/em&gt;), but it&amp;rsquo;s even more interesting to me when the concept of the superhero is taken philosophically and explored as a potential humanist value system (or at least the vehicle for one).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, yeah. I love the Doom Patrol and I love this issue&amp;rsquo;s story as an awe-inspiring demonstration of superheroes through those characters.&lt;/p&gt;
