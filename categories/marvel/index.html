    First, a note: my random number generator seems to keep pointing me to issues numbering in the 70s. An interesting trend so far. Okay, so, more Doctor Strange! And this time, it&rsquo;s from the 1970s-80s series (a predecessor to the series discussed in my earlier Doctor Strange review). The cover to Doctor Strange #072 shows Doctor Strange, with an absolutely metal beard, wrapped in the tentacles of some green Lovecraftian creature whose limbs and cilia are writhing about.

      <div class="meta">Thu, Nov 10, 2016</div>
    </header>

    Marvel Comics Presents (or MCP) is a series that interested me for the longest time: it was an anthology comic that tended to have four stories (each 8 pages) of varying length, by which I mean that one story might have 8-10 parts, another might have 4-6, another might only be a single 8-page story, and so on. So a reader was likely to get some really fascinating story turnover in any given collection of issues.

      <div class="meta">Wed, Nov 9, 2016</div>
    </header>

    Namor, The Sub-Mariner was the first comic for which I ever had a subscription (my subscription was from issue 18-29). I don&rsquo;t recall all the details about this, but I know that we had some sort of postal issue that prevented me from getting an issue or two initially, so my dad and I called Marvel. It turned out that they were having a Christmas party at the time, and Stan Lee himself picked up the phone.

      <div class="meta">Wed, Nov 2, 2016</div>
    </header>

    Today&rsquo;s review features Cable, a character that, along with Deadpool, has somehow managed to survive the &lsquo;90s boom that spawned him. I was never fully sold on the extreme nature of the Liefeld X-Force, but I suppose I get why Cable remains interesting to many. He was, for some time, the consummate 1980s action hero ideal, a &ldquo;mystery man&rdquo; and &ldquo;tactical badass&rdquo; that speaks directly to the fantasies of the stereotypical superhero comic consumer.

      <h2><a href='https://brocktopus.github.io/longbox/post/Master-of-Kung-Fu-071/'> Master of Kung Fu 071</a> </h2>
      <div class="meta">Sun, Oct 30, 2016</div>
    </header>

    Shang-Chi, the master of kung fu, is one of Marvel&rsquo;s greatest martial arts characters, and one who was born during the company&rsquo;s 1970s-era efforts to exploit the martial arts movie craze (although I admit I&rsquo;m a bigger fan of Shang-Chi frenemy Shen Kuei, &ldquo;the Cat&rdquo;). This series is definitely a reflection of that time, and it&rsquo;s Doug Moench&rsquo;s magnum opus (although, sadly, this particular issue doesn&rsquo;t feature Paul Gulacy, whose work meshed excellently with Moench, although the artist here, Mike Zeck, also does a solid job with the kung fu/espionage style the book goes for).

      <div class="meta">Fri, Oct 28, 2016</div>
    </header>

    Journey Into Mystery was the comic in which Thor first appeared, and it&rsquo;s awesome that Marvel revived this title in order to make space for Asgard tales (the &ldquo;Tales from Asgard&rdquo; in the back of older Thor comics were great, but wayyyyy too short to enjoy thoroughly). I remember buying this comic from a dollar bin in 2014 or maybe 2015. The cover alone made it worth the price: Lady Sif looks totally badass, striding directly toward the viewer in a suit of battle armor&mdash;mostly practical, too!

    <p>It is perhaps fitting that the first comic randomly selected to serve as a review post is a <em>Doctor Strange</em> comic, since I have long adored the character.</p>
