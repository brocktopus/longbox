        <section id="main">
          <h5 id="date"> Thu Nov 10, 2016 </h5>
          <p><em>Marvel Comics Presents</em> (or <em>MCP</em>) is a series that interested me for the longest time: it was an anthology comic that tended to have four stories (each 8 pages) of varying length, by which I mean that one story might have 8-10 parts, another might have 4-6, another might only be a single 8-page story, and so on. So a reader was likely to get some really fascinating story turnover in any given collection of issues. When I was young, <em>MCP</em> introduced me to some characters that I don&rsquo;t think I ever would have checked out otherwise, most notably (for me) Shang-Chi, but also minor characters like Stingray or the Collective Man.</p>

<p>The primary story of many <em>MCP</em> issues featured Wolverine&ndash;unsurprising, given his ability to sell pretty much any comic where he appeared on the cover. <em>MCP</em> 072, however, is important because it begins the tale of an incredibly significant part of Wolverine&rsquo;s backstory, written &amp; drawn by Barry Windsor-Smith: the Weapon X experiments that bonded adamantium to his skeleton.</p>

<p>The cover for issue 072, like all of the <em>MCP</em> covers, is wraparound, with the primary (Wolverine) story featured on the front and the characters of the other three stories&ndash;Daredevil, Shanna the She-Devil, and Red Wolf&ndash;on the back. On the front half, Wolverine stands, the right half of his body covered by his classic brown-and-yellow suit, and his left half naked with a number of protruding spikes in preparation for his adamantium injections. Behind him is a large skull (likely his own), with similar spikes. Flames beneath a blank blue canvas comprise the background, layered (from top down) yellow, orange, and red. At the top of the page, below the comic&rsquo;s title/logo, are the words: &ldquo;Before Wolverine there was Weapon X.&rdquo; On the back half of the cover, Shanna is posed crouching (with a caption box that declares &ldquo;Her <strong>jungle</strong> reeks of <strong>evil</strong>, and SHANNA must <strong>confront</strong> it.&ldquo;), while Red Wolf leaps behind her, up and to her left (captioned &ldquo;RED WOLF <strong>faces</strong> the <strong>death</strong> of his <strong>partner Lobo</strong>!&ldquo;). Behind her, down and to the right, Daredevil similarly jumps forward, swinging his billy club (caption: &ldquo;DAREDEVIL is <strong>helpless</strong> when things come to a <strong>head</strong> in <strong>New York</strong>&rdquo;). What appears to be the back side of the large skull from the front cover looms behind the figures.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;Weapon X&rdquo; story in this issue must have been <em>ridiculously</em> confusing to everyone when it initially came out, since it consists of three threads: (1) Wolverine down on his luck in the Yukon, drinking and getting in fights; (2) flashes of the Weapon X experiments themselves, provided without explanation/context; (3) panels of a scientist performing some sort of experiment that may or may not be (but almost certainly is) related to the Weapon X project.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t actually pick up this issue until last year, but I already knew the general beats to this story. I have to say, in its serialized form, I&rsquo;m a bit disappointed since there&rsquo;s no real room for anything to breathe here (although I get that BWS is trying to let things unfold in a somewhat-similar manner to Logan&rsquo;s ability to comprehend what happened to him). The art style and the narration is solid&ndash;it does its job of leaving me wanting more. I&rsquo;m just torn in both wanting more and not feeling like I really had &ldquo;enough&rdquo; in this portion to really enjoy.</p>

<p>The Shanna comic provided is part 5 of its story. I&rsquo;m stoked going in because there&rsquo;s Paul Gulacy art&ndash;which I know is not everyone&rsquo;s cup of tea but he is great at &ldquo;realistic&rdquo; comic stories (such as his run on <em>Master of Kung Fu</em>) so I&rsquo;m expecting strong work here. Shanna and some others are tracking diamond smugglers and poachers through/near Tanzania. This part of the story does a really successful job at showing the violence and tragedy that accompanies such acts, and the cliffhanger&ndash;where Shanna discovers someone (a local?) buried up to his neck amid massive anthills&ndash;is creepy and suspenseful. Unlike with the Wolverine story, I have a clear sense of where this is going (without bringing in retrospective knowledge of the overall plot).</p>

<p>In contrast, I don&rsquo;t really know how to explain the Daredevil component (it&rsquo;s part 4 and the final part, apparently, of a story). There&rsquo;s apparently been a heat weave, and tensions are running high as people get frustrated. A woman named Ms. Pinkwater, whose defining feature is a Carmen Sandiego hat, is doing &hellip; something? I can&rsquo;t really figure it out. Anyway, apparently a bunch of people hold hands and sing or something, and it causes rain to fall and all tensions in the city to relax. Daredevil doesn&rsquo;t really do anything other than read a handwritten note that asks him not to do anything. What the hell?</p>

<p>The Red Wolf story&ndash;which I think is a standalone story&ndash;is equally weak. Red Wolf begins in a lodge, ruminating on the loss of his wolf partner Lobo, while a truck full of drunks look for something to hunt. They eventually discover a mother wolf feeding her cubs and proceed to kill almost all of them (save one), when Red Wolf finally acts. Even then, he&rsquo;s nearly taken out until one of the hunters decides they&rsquo;ve gone too far and has a standoff with his buddy. Red Wolf, meanwhile, takes the surviving cub (presumably to raise himself).</p>

<p>All in all, this issue is a decent representative for <em>MCP</em> in general: there&rsquo;s some interesting experimentation happening and some solid, compelling story work &hellip; but there are also stinkers that don&rsquo;t feel really worthwhile or well-realized. Does the former cancel out the latter? Yes and no&ndash;certainly enough, for me, to not absolutely hate the series, but not so much that I forget nostalgia is a big part of my enjoyment of this series.</p>
