        <p class="lead"> Welcome to <cite>From the Long Box</cite>! </p>

        <p>
          On this site, I review comic books in my collection. The order of the reviews is randomly generated from my database of issues&mdash;mostly so that I don't have to choose specific issues to review, but also so that I may be pleasantly surprised by each issue.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Currently, my plan is to provide a new review each Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. We'll see how long I can keep up that pace. (Some reviews may appear slightly ahead of schedule.)

    </header>

    I think that this might be the newest of all the comics I&rsquo;ve reviewed so far. Green Lanterns is a series starring Simon Baz and Jessica Cruz, two novice members of the Green Lantern Corps, each saddled with their own hang-ups about being a hero. They were paired up by Hal Jordan and tasked with protecting Earth while he went out into outer space to locate the rest of the Green Lantern Corps (as they had gone missing at the time).

      <div class="meta">Thu, Nov 17, 2016</div>
    </header>

    While Green Lantern remains perhaps my favorite character-specific franchise, Astro City is far and away my single favorite series, ever. It is superhero comics world-building done expertly, pulling together and twisting tropes in a way that has not been done as fully, consistently, or enjoyably by anyone else. Kurt Busiek has it all together here and presents it in full force with Alex Ross covers and (usually) Brent Anderson art. Astro City is a comic whose stories focus on the titular city (located on the west coast, standing in the place of San Francisco or Seattle), which is populated by more than a century of superhero history.

    </header>

    First, a note: my random number generator seems to keep pointing me to issues numbering in the 70s. An interesting trend so far. Okay, so, more Doctor Strange! And this time, it&rsquo;s from the 1970s-80s series (a predecessor to the series discussed in my earlier Doctor Strange review). The cover to Doctor Strange #072 shows Doctor Strange, with an absolutely metal beard, wrapped in the tentacles of some green Lovecraftian creature whose limbs and cilia are writhing about.

    </header>

    &ldquo;Gone, gone, o form of man! Rise the demon Etrigan!&rdquo; Etrigan the demon is a great character, even if Jack Kirby wasn&rsquo;t really into it. Arthurian knight Jason Blood, cursed to inhabit the same body/space as Etrigan, a demon bound into Merlin&rsquo;s service, has been developed as an incredibly cornerstone of DC&rsquo;s supernatural/horror sphere of comics. (This was made most obvious in Alan Moore&rsquo;s run on Saga of the Swap Thing, where Etrigan&rsquo;s rhyming was excellently elevated to a characteristic of Hell&rsquo;s lieutenants.) The cover to The Demon issue 002 shows Etrigan crouched on a stone archway, which is dripping water, in a town with a medieval aesthetic or a castle square at nighttime (as the moon is visible on the horizon), ready to pounce on a group of torch-wielding citizens and a uniformed inspector.

      <div class="meta">Thu, Nov 10, 2016</div>
    </header>

    Marvel Comics Presents (or MCP) is a series that interested me for the longest time: it was an anthology comic that tended to have four stories (each 8 pages) of varying length, by which I mean that one story might have 8-10 parts, another might have 4-6, another might only be a single 8-page story, and so on. So a reader was likely to get some really fascinating story turnover in any given collection of issues.

      <div class="meta">Wed, Nov 9, 2016</div>
    </header>

    Namor, The Sub-Mariner was the first comic for which I ever had a subscription (my subscription was from issue 18-29). I don&rsquo;t recall all the details about this, but I know that we had some sort of postal issue that prevented me from getting an issue or two initially, so my dad and I called Marvel. It turned out that they were having a Christmas party at the time, and Stan Lee himself picked up the phone.

      <div class="meta">Sun, Nov 6, 2016</div>
    </header>

    The first Vertigo post for this blog is also the first Animal Man post. Ahh, Animal Man. Such a great character raised out of mediocre beginnings. Without getting too mired in details, it&rsquo;s enough to say that Buddy Baker&ndash;Animal Man&ndash;can tap into the abilities of animals and make use thereof to fight injustice. Also, unlike most superheroes, he has a family (a wife, Ellen, and two children, Cliff and Maxine). This is important, because the central conflict in Buddy&rsquo;s life is the tug-of-war that constantly occurs between his desire to live a normal life with his family and his desire to use his powers in the best and most effective way possible (often to try and raise awareness about animal rights and ecological issues).

      <div class="meta">Fri, Nov 4, 2016</div>
    </header>

    JUSTICE LEAGUE EUROPE! Possibly the greatest Europe-based superhero team from one of the big two comics companies. Justice League Europe / Justice League International were incredible series in the late 80s/early 90s that really embraced the goofiness of shining a spotlight on a band of B- and C-list heroes. Keith Giffen and Bart Sears worked so well together to make the comic so believable and staunchly ridiculous at the same time.

      <div class="meta">Wed, Nov 2, 2016</div>
    </header>

    Today&rsquo;s review features Cable, a character that, along with Deadpool, has somehow managed to survive the &lsquo;90s boom that spawned him. I was never fully sold on the extreme nature of the Liefeld X-Force, but I suppose I get why Cable remains interesting to many. He was, for some time, the consummate 1980s action hero ideal, a &ldquo;mystery man&rdquo; and &ldquo;tactical badass&rdquo; that speaks directly to the fantasies of the stereotypical superhero comic consumer.

      <div class="meta">Sun, Oct 30, 2016</div>
    </header>

    Shang-Chi, the master of kung fu, is one of Marvel&rsquo;s greatest martial arts characters, and one who was born during the company&rsquo;s 1970s-era efforts to exploit the martial arts movie craze (although I admit I&rsquo;m a bigger fan of Shang-Chi frenemy Shen Kuei, &ldquo;the Cat&rdquo;). This series is definitely a reflection of that time, and it&rsquo;s Doug Moench&rsquo;s magnum opus (although, sadly, this particular issue doesn&rsquo;t feature Paul Gulacy, whose work meshed excellently with Moench, although the artist here, Mike Zeck, also does a solid job with the kung fu/espionage style the book goes for).
