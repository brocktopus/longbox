        <p class="lead"> Welcome to <cite>From the Long Box</cite>! </p>

        <p>
          On this site, I review comic books in my collection. The order of the reviews is randomly generated from my database of issues&mdash;mostly so that I don't have to choose specific issues to review, but also so that I may be pleasantly surprised by each issue.
        </p>
        
        <p>
          Currently, my plan is to provide a new review each Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. We'll see how long I can keep up that pace. (Some reviews may appear slightly ahead of schedule.)

    </header>

    Hey, a Mark Gruenwald issue of Captain America! And part of &ldquo;The Bloodstone Saga,&rdquo; to boot! But how well does it stack up to my memory? My youngest brother, Patrick, is far more of a Captain America fan than I am. I think it&rsquo;s fair to say that he, like me, really digs the Brubaker era most of all (which brought us the Winter Soldier and the assassination of Steve Rogers).

      <div class="meta">Wed, Nov 30, 2016</div>
    </header>

    As I&rsquo;ve noted elsewhere, I own more Green Lantern comics than any other title/franchise, so I suppose it&rsquo;s not surprising that the random selection of the comics I&rsquo;m reviewing would hit multiple GL issues so early. Green Lantern 046 is smack in the middle of Geoff Johns&rsquo; epic space opera run on the character, so this issue is pretty much 100% action&ndash;a stark contrast to the laser-focused character development of some other comics I&rsquo;ve discussed recently.

      <div class="meta">Mon, Nov 28, 2016</div>
    </header>

    Starman was a comic by James Robinson, Tony Harris, Peter Snejberg, and other assorted artists in the mid-90s that told the tale of a young man named Jack Knight. Jack was the son of Golden Age (1940s)-era Starman Ted Knight and the younger brother of short-lived Starman David Knight. (There were a few other heroes who went by the name Starman, as well, but the Knight family really &ldquo;owns&rdquo; the role.) Jack had the hero role thrust upon him when his brother was murdered one night; Jack avenged his brother and decided to protect his city as his family had done.

      <div class="meta">Thu, Nov 24, 2016</div>
    </header>

    While I am a huge fan of Kurt Busiek&rsquo;s Astro City comic, I never really found myself getting into his run on Avengers (the second or third volume) while it happened. (I think at the time I was really into Bendis&rsquo; Daredevil and Morrison&rsquo;s New X-Men instead, since they were more blatantly and fully pushing back against some of Marvel&rsquo;s status quo.) At any rate, in retrospect, this issue is fantastic, but not because it&rsquo;s an Avengers comic.

      <div class="meta">Tue, Nov 22, 2016</div>
    </header>

    Daredevil is a character I&rsquo;ve always thought was great, and this volume (running from roughly 1998-2011 or so?) is absolutely incredible. A blind superhero whose existence is anathema to his sworn profession as a lawyer? Sign me up. Oh, he&rsquo;s also a Catholic? and wants to protect his neighborhood rather than the world? Yeah, this is the recipe for an amazing comic. I happened to begin picking up this particular series when Brian Bendis took over on issue 26, and I followed it for several years (until the mid-60s issues) and have been trying to complete the run since then.

      <div class="meta">Mon, Nov 21, 2016</div>
    </header>

    I think that this might be the newest of all the comics I&rsquo;ve reviewed so far. Green Lanterns is a series starring Simon Baz and Jessica Cruz, two novice members of the Green Lantern Corps, each saddled with their own hang-ups about being a hero. They were paired up by Hal Jordan and tasked with protecting Earth while he went out into outer space to locate the rest of the Green Lantern Corps (as they had gone missing at the time).

      <div class="meta">Thu, Nov 17, 2016</div>
    </header>

    While Green Lantern remains perhaps my favorite character-specific franchise, Astro City is far and away my single favorite series, ever. It is superhero comics world-building done expertly, pulling together and twisting tropes in a way that has not been done as fully, consistently, or enjoyably by anyone else. Kurt Busiek has it all together here and presents it in full force with Alex Ross covers and (usually) Brent Anderson art. Astro City is a comic whose stories focus on the titular city (located on the west coast, standing in the place of San Francisco or Seattle), which is populated by more than a century of superhero history.

      <div class="meta">Tue, Nov 15, 2016</div>
    </header>

    First, a note: my random number generator seems to keep pointing me to issues numbering in the 70s. An interesting trend so far. Okay, so, more Doctor Strange! And this time, it&rsquo;s from the 1970s-80s series (a predecessor to the series discussed in my earlier Doctor Strange review). The cover to Doctor Strange #072 shows Doctor Strange, with an absolutely metal beard, wrapped in the tentacles of some green Lovecraftian creature whose limbs and cilia are writhing about.

      <div class="meta">Sun, Nov 13, 2016</div>
    </header>

    &ldquo;Gone, gone, o form of man! Rise the demon Etrigan!&rdquo; Etrigan the demon is a great character, even if Jack Kirby wasn&rsquo;t really into it. Arthurian knight Jason Blood, cursed to inhabit the same body/space as Etrigan, a demon bound into Merlin&rsquo;s service, has been developed as an incredibly cornerstone of DC&rsquo;s supernatural/horror sphere of comics. (This was made most obvious in Alan Moore&rsquo;s run on Saga of the Swap Thing, where Etrigan&rsquo;s rhyming was excellently elevated to a characteristic of Hell&rsquo;s lieutenants.) The cover to The Demon issue 002 shows Etrigan crouched on a stone archway, which is dripping water, in a town with a medieval aesthetic or a castle square at nighttime (as the moon is visible on the horizon), ready to pounce on a group of torch-wielding citizens and a uniformed inspector.

      <div class="meta">Thu, Nov 10, 2016</div>
    </header>

    Marvel Comics Presents (or MCP) is a series that interested me for the longest time: it was an anthology comic that tended to have four stories (each 8 pages) of varying length, by which I mean that one story might have 8-10 parts, another might have 4-6, another might only be a single 8-page story, and so on. So a reader was likely to get some really fascinating story turnover in any given collection of issues.
